🐱‍🏍 I'm a college student,specialized in CS.

🤗 I'm fond of coding,designing a complex function and watching my own projects operating,that's why now I'm learning backend,looking forward to being a backend engineer!

🤩 I'm interested in open source,currently trying to make more contibutions:

  **>>>** Firstly,I have made some documentation contributions such as adding some text,which is easy to do but gets me familiar with the contributing process.
  
  **>>>** Secondly,I'm now working on some good-first-issues,which requires me to do some easy coding.
  
  **>>>** Next,I'd like to work on some more complex issues......
  
 🤗 Hope one day I can become a good contributor.
